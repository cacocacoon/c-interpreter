When I was studying in University, this project was the most difficult and impressive one, it could be separate to three parts, tokenization, lexical analyzer and evaluator, and I introduced a design pattern which is interpreter pattern into my project, the pattern makes my code clear and scalability.
	The interpreter could deal with statements and expressions, such as IF ELSE, WHILE, DO WHILE,  block scope variable declaration, and detect grammar error.
